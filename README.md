Weather Widget Project

Overview:

The Weather Widget is a dynamic web application designed to provide users with current weather information for any specified location. This project is part of the 30 Days of 30 Projects initiative from the Governor IT Initiative Program, aimed at enhancing my skills in web development and API integration.

Key Features:

City Search:
Users can input a city name to fetch its current weather data, promoting user engagement and interactivity.

Real-Time Weather Display:
The widget displays:

Current Temperature: Shown in Celsius, accompanied by a user-friendly message tailored to the temperature range.

Weather Conditions: Clear descriptions of the weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) with corresponding messages to inform users about expected weather phenomena.

Location Context: Provides a contextual message about the time of day at the specified location (day or night).

Error Handling: The application gracefully handles errors, such as invalid city names or empty input, displaying relevant messages to guide users.

Technologies Used:

React:
Employed for building a responsive user interface and managing application state with hooks.

TypeScript:
Utilized for type safety, enhancing code reliability.

Weather API:
Integrated with an external weather API (WeatherAPI) to fetch real-time data.

Conclusion:

This Weather Widget project showcases my ability to create interactive web applications using React and API integration. It serves as a practical demonstration of handling user input, managing application state, and providing real-time feedback, setting a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future.
